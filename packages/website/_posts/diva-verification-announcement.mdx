The goal of the DIVA testnet was to reward everyone who took the time to try out and explore the functionality of the DIVA App by completing the testnet tasks. 
One of the main problems in the context of airdrops are Sybil attackers who try to maximize their token allocation by creating multiple 
accounts pretending to be independent and unique users. As the DIVA token reward pool for the first testnet phase was capped at 1 million, users with multiple accounts 
were diluting the allocation of single-account users, hence putting them at a significant disadvantage. 

During the testnet phase, we have received reports of several cases where users were identified to have used multiple accounts. We were also made aware of tutorial videos that 
suggested users to use multiple accounts. Initial analysis of the testnet data also suggests that some users tried to participate multiple times. Some community members were
asking to address this problem. 

90% of users have spent at least 30 minutest to complete all the tasks. 

Our goal is to ensure a fair and equitable DIVA token distribution and maximize the reward for every participant. and address the concerns of the DIVA community, we will conduct an additional verification step. Details about the procedure
including time and duration will be announced in a separate article. It won't be KYC, though.

The DIVA token reward per testnet participant will be announced after the verification process.

* Only users that participated in the testnet will be required to verify their discord account
* Users that are identified using multiple accounts during the verification process will not receive any reward. If you have used multiple accounts, make sure 
you verify only one account during the verification process to not risk losing your reward.
* The verification will be open for 3 days. Tell all your friends that participated in the DIVA testnet to verify their Discord accounts.



One of the key concerns during any anticipated airdrop or token distribution event are Sybil attacks. To maximize the token allocation during token drops, 
some individuals or organizations create multiple online accounts pretending to be independent and unique users. 



## Weekly quiz

We will be running a weekly DIVA Protocol quiz in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/8fAvUspmv3). A dedicated #quiz channel has been created for 
this purpose where we ask 5 to 15 questions at random points in time during the week. Each question answered 
correctly by the first member of the community will receive a reward of 100 DIVA token claims. After answering 
the question correctly and being approved by the DIVA team, the winner is requested to submit their wallet address. 
When the DIVA protocol launches its mainnet, winners will be able to claim their rewards.

**It‚Äôs important to highlight that winners need to have completed all the testnet tasks in order to be eligible 
for the reward.** The completion of all testnet tasks will be a requirement for all future reward opportunities 
and beneficial beyond the testnet. If you are new to our community, read our 
[testnet announcement](https://www.divaprotocol.io/posts/diva-testnet-announcement) to learn how to participate. 

## Quiz rules summarized

* Only the first community member with the correct answer to a question will be rewarded with 100 DIVA Tokens.  
* To be eligible for the reward, you must have completed all the testnet tasks.
* Team members and moderators are excluded from the competition.
* A community member is allowed to earn rewards as many times as possible.

## What is DIVA Protocol
DIVA Protocol is a unique piece of decentralized infrastructure that allows everyone to create and settle 
fully customizable event-driven products (also known as ‚Äúderivatives‚Äù) in a permissionless way. Users can 
choose any public data feed as the underlying (e.g., the price of an asset or a basket of assets, the TVL 
locked in DeFi, Ethereum gas price, Bitcoin hash rate, etc.) and combine it with a wide range of possible 
[payoff profiles](https://docs.divaprotocol.io/getting-started/create-position-tokens/payoff-curves) 
(binary, linear, convex, or concave) to create truly [unique products in DeFi](https://docs.divaprotocol.io/use-cases/insurance).
