After many months of hard work and sweat, we are thrilled to announce the launch of the DIVA App on the Ropsten testnet. 
The goal of this release is to collect early user feedback to further improve the app ahead of the mainnet launch later this year. 
The best part about all this is that you get rewarded with a claim on the future DIVA token for trying out the app without 
risking real assets ü§Ø. Read on to find out how to participate.

## What is the DIVA App?

The DIVA App is the first implementation of a web application built on top of [DIVA Protocol](https://docs.divaprotocol.io/), 
a highly customizable and decentralized piece of infrastructure that allows users to create and settle event-linked products 
(so-called ‚Äúderivatives‚Äú). The DIVA App allows users to create and trade a wide variety of derivative products which can 
be used for hedging or betting purposes.

## Learn-to-earn

One of the initiatives that we will be running to coincide with the testnet launch is the Learn-to-earn program. 
The goal of this program is to reward users with a claim on the future DIVA token for exploring the functionality offered by the DIVA App 
and providing valuable feedback that will help us to further improve the app ahead of the mainnet launch later this year. 
We believe that this approach is more likely to convert users into long-term believers and supporters compared to a random airdrop model. 
Read about the role of the DIVA token in DIVA Protocol in our [gitbook](https://docs.divaprotocol.io/introduction/diva-token).

The best part about the DIVA testnet is that users are not putting any real assets at risk. All interactions with the DIVA App take 
place on the Ropsten testnet using fake ERC20 tokens and fake ETH.

## How it works

There will be a total of **15 tasks** that users will be asked to complete, each covering one specific functionality of the 
DIVA App (see the list of tasks further down below). Each completed task will earn users 200 points. User‚Äôs will 
be able to multiply their score in two ways:
- **1.5x**: Users that complete all tasks will receive an ‚Äúexpert multiple‚Äù of 1.5x on their total score resulting in 4500 points.
- **3.0x**: Users that complete all tasks AND hold a whale from our founders‚Äô 888whales.art NFT collection at the time of the DIVA 
token launch event, will receive a ‚Äúwhale multiple‚Äù of 3.0x on their total score resulting in 9000 points. 
**Note that holding more than one whale will not give you any additional advantage.**

Each point collected represents a claim on one future DIVA token up to a cap of 1 million DIVA tokens (1% of total supply). 
This means that if the aggregate points collected by all testnet users exceed 1 million, each user‚Äôs claim will be cut back pro-rata. 
For example, if the aggregate points collected by testnet users is 2 million, then each point will represent a claim on 0.5 DIVA tokens.

Due to the dependency on the aggregate points collected by testnet users, the final DIVA token rewards will be determined and 
published after the testnet phase. Testnet participants will be able to claim their share of the DIVA token at the token launch event.
