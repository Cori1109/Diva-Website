We are excited to share an update on the latest developments around DIVA Protocol, the DIVA App, the on-going testnet and all on-going initiatives with our community. We keep the intro short as there is a lot to cover.

## App
Over the last couple of weeks, we have released the following new features in the app:
* **Card view:** Users can now switch between Line view and Card view on the Markets page. The Card view was primarily designed to have a mobile-friendly way to display the products and their details on the Markets page.
* **Trade chart:** In preparation for the re-design of the trading page, we have upgraded the payoff chart design, moved it more prominently into the middle of
the page and consolidated a lot of information that was previously spread across the page. For instance, the current underlying value, the break-even as 
well as parameters governing the shape of the payoff profile (floor, inflection, cap and gradient) are now baked into the chart.
* **Filters:** We have re-visited the functionality and updated the design of the filters on the Markets and My Dashboard page.
* **Mobile responsiveness:** We have made the Create flow as well as the Testnet tasks page more mobile-friendly. We are working on making the remaining parts of the app over the coming weeks.   


**In progress:**
* **New app design:** All app designs have been finalized and are now being implemented. Here a few exclusive insights.
* **Create Offer flow:** We are adding an option for users to create derivative products in a more gas efficient and flexible way. Users will no longer have to create derivative products on-chain
and take on the risk of not finding a counterparty. Instead, users will be able to create signed off-chain commitments to take either the long or short side of the derivative contract at very specific terms and share them 
with potential counterparties via various off-chain communication channels (e.g., email or chat). The derivative products are created only once a counterparty is found. 
Further, the Create Offer functionality will also remove the need for the creator to deposit the full collateral amount. Instead, a user can specify in the offer terms how much collateral each party has to contribute. With that,
the sale of the long or short side, which in the current setup has to be conducted after a contingent pool has been created, would become part of the product creation process. 
* **Show best bid/ask on Markets page:** An efficient way to display the best bid/ask rates on the Markets page is under development.

## Smart contracts
* The EIP712 module which enables the Create Offer flow described above has been integrated into DIVA Protocol. We are preparing everything for another audit to 
ensure that the new functionality is bug-free.
* We are planning an incentivized code review program where we will invite Solidity developers and reward them in claims on the future DIVA token for reviewing and providing feedback on the code.

## Testnet
### Migration from Ropsten to Goerli
On 19th August, Graph Protocol stopped its support for Ropsten. As the DIVA App is using Graph Protocol to capture and display blockchain data in the app, we were forced to switch
all parts of the app to Goerli, the new Ethereum test network. This move was expected and most of the preparations for the migration have been done on our side. Unfortunately, one important piece of infrastructure, namely 
the 0x api server which is maintained by the 0x protocol team and responsible for hosting signed trade orders, turned out to have limited functionality on Goerli. As a result, users were no longer able to trade and 
complete the four trade related testnet tasks. 

For those that participated in the testnet while it was running on Ropsten, all progress is saved. Users have to complete only those tasks that were open on Ropsten. We are in the process of integrating the Ropsten completion
status into the app to avoid any confusion.

The good thing about all this is that it forced us to look into how to run the server ourselves. We are confident to fix the trading functionality soon.



### Testnet stats

## New DIVA website
We are in the process of redesigning the [DIVA Protocol website](https://www.divaprotocol.io/) to present DIVA Protocol and its features in the best possible way. In particular,
we are planning to integrate an app store where we will start listing apps that are built on top of DIVA Protocol with DIVA App being the first one. 

## Quiz
End of July, we announced an incentivized [quiz](https://www.divaprotocol.io/posts/diva-incentivized-diva-quiz) where we give users a chance to earn additional claims
on the future DIVA token by proving their knowledge about DIVA Protocol and the DIVA App. The quiz has gained a lot of traction with 37 community members being able to secure a spot 
on the leaderboard. It was particularly great to see that some members have built very solid knowledge  

The quiz contributes to one of our main goals to built an informed and knowledgeable community to ensure the long-term success of the DIVA project.

The quiz, where we ask questions at random points in time during the week and reward correct answers, gained a lot of traction. As of today, we count 37 community members on the leaderboard 

The super quiz turned out where we give many community members a chance.

were able to answer one of the posted questions and earn a claim on the future DIVA token. 
It is great to see that some community members have already built very solid knowledge about DIVA Protocol and leverage that to increase their DIVA token reward.
If you haven't followed all the questions, we have compiled most of them here: [Quiz questions](https://docs.divaprotocol.io/guides/quiz)

We have decided to not publish the answers to increase the learn effect ;-)


## Tellor oracle integration
We are closely working with the Tellor team to connect Tellor Protocol as the first decentralized to DIVA Protocol to give users the highest confidence that derivative products will settle correctly.

## App migration

## Testnet phase 2

## Farmer insurance
The [article on the farmer insurance](https://www.divaprotocol.io/posts/diva-how-diva-protocol-can-help-unlock-affordable-insurance-for-farmers) use case
 enabled by DIVA Protocol sparked some excitement with some organizations in Africa. We are currently exploring a pilot program with a set of farmers.





## Join DIVA App testnet

You can still participate in this exciting development if you haven't registered for the testnet yet. It is running until September 30, 2022. 

Kindly head to our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/DE5b8ZeJjK) and sign up on the Register Channel to be a part of building the future of derivatives. Don't forget your participation in the testnet guarantees a share in the DIVA token when it is finally live.
