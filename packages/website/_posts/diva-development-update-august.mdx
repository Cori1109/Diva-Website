We are excited to share an update on the latest developments around DIVA Protocol, the DIVA App, the on-going testnet and all on-going initiatives. 

## App
Over the last couple of weeks, we have released the following new features in the app:
* **Card view:** Users can now switch between Line view and Card view on the Markets page. The Card view was primarily designed for users that want to access the app from their mobile.
* **Trade chart:** In preparation for the redesign of the trading page, we have moved the payoff chart more prominently into the middle of
the page and consolidated a lot of information that was previously spread across the page. For instance, terms like "Gradient" and "Inflection" are no longer visible making
it easier for visitors to digest the information. Also, information like the current underlying, break-even as well as the parameters governing the shape of the payoff curve have been baked
into the chart.
* **Filters:** We have revisited the filters on the Markets and My Dashboard page and updated the design to better fit into the overall app design
* **Mobile friendly create process:** We have adjusted the Create flow to be compatible with mobile format.  

* **App designs:** The app designs are now ready and being implemented.

In progress:
* **Create offer flow:** Currently, the creation of a contingent pool requires the user to deposit all the collateral. 
* **Show best bid/ask on Markets page:**
* **Fix 0x server:**

## New DIVA website
We are in the process of redesigning the [DIVA Protocol website](https://www.divaprotocol.io/) to present DIVA Protocol and its features in the best possible way. In particular,
we are planning to integrate an app store where we will start listing apps that are built on top of DIVA Protocol with DIVA App being the first one. 

## Quiz
End of July, we announced an incentivized [quiz](https://www.divaprotocol.io/posts/diva-incentivized-diva-quiz) where we give users a chance to earn additional claims
on the future DIVA token by proving their knowledge about DIVA Protocol and the DIVA App. The quiz has gained a lot of traction with 37 community members being able to secure a spot 
on the leaderboard. It was particularly great to see that some members have built very solid knowledge  

The quiz contributes to one of our main goals to built an informed and knowledgeable community to ensure the long-term success of the DIVA project.

The quiz, where we ask questions at random points in time during the week and reward correct answers, gained a lot of traction. As of today, we count 37 community members on the leaderboard 

The super quiz turned out where we give many community members a chance.

were able to answer one of the posted questions and earn a claim on the future DIVA token. 
It is great to see that some community members have already built very solid knowledge about DIVA Protocol and leverage that to increase their DIVA token reward.
If you haven't followed all the questions, we have compiled most of them here: [Quiz questions](https://docs.divaprotocol.io/guides/quiz)

We have decided to not publish the answers to increase the learn effect ;-)


## Tellor oracle integration
We are closely working with the Tellor team to connect Tellor Protocol as the first decentralized to DIVA Protocol to give users the highest confidence that derivative products will settle correctly.

## App migration

## Testnet phase 2

## Farmer insurance
The [article on the farmer insurance](https://www.divaprotocol.io/posts/diva-how-diva-protocol-can-help-unlock-affordable-insurance-for-farmers) use case
 enabled by DIVA Protocol sparked some excitement with some organizations in Africa. We are currently exploring a pilot program with a set of farmers.



## Testnet
On 19th August, Graph Protocol, which the DIVA App is using under the hood to capture blockchain data, announced that it stopped supporting Ropsten, the testnet that the DIVA testnet was running on. 
This meant that blockchain data emitted during the  Testnet transactions (e.g., when creating a contingent pool) were no longer indexed and as a result not showing up in the app. This was expected and
all preparations for the switch to the new test network Goerli were already done.
