From the very beginning, it was clear to us that 888Whales will be more than just another NFT project. Besides launching one of the first NFT projects, that was addressing the Twitter profile banner space, we were heads-down building something exciting in the background. Over the last couple of weeks, we gave a few hints via our Twitter channel. Today is the day where we want to become more specific about our plans.

Today, we want to announce that everyone who purchased an 888Whale until 31 January 2022 will be eligible for a 5'000 DIVA token airdrop per whale when we launch the DIVA token later this year. This is equivalent to $500 assuming a $10m market cap of DIVA protocol.

## What is DIVA?

DIVA is a highly customizable derivatives protocol that will allow the creation of a wide range of financial products including:

- üìà Prediction markets
- üõ° Insurance products
- üí∞ Yield generating products

The DIVA token will be the protocol‚Äôs native governance token which will come with rights to vote on protocol upgrades, how to spend the DIVA treasury and much more.

Read our whitepaper and try out our MVP to learn how it works. For a guide how to use the MPV, see here.

## Why do we do that?

DIVA is a self-funded project and everyone who purchased a whale NFT helped us indirectly to finance the development of the DIVA protocol. This AirDrop is our way to say thank you to our wonderful 888Whales community üôè.

## Who is eligible for the AirDrop?

To avoid that 888Whale NFTs are traded as proxies for the upcoming DIVA token, only first time buyers with snapshot date 31 January 2022 will be eligible for the AirDrop. Further, first time buyers have to hold on to their whale until the DIVA token launch later this year, otherwise they lose their eligibility status. So far, all whale buyers have chosen to HODL to their whale(s) which we are very proud of.

The AirDrop is per whale rather than per account basis meaning that if you purchased 5 whales, you will receive 5 x 5'000 DIVA tokens. Eligible Ethereum addresses will be whitelisted and able to claim their DIVA token allocation at the time of the token launch later this year.

## Will there be more AirDrops for 888Whale holders in the future?

This has not been decided yet. If you want to earn DIVA tokens, though, join our discord channel and watch out for the announcement of the incentivized testnet in Q2 2022.

## What will happen to the 888Whales project?

The 888Whales project is very close to our heart and we have so many exciting features in the pipeline. While our focus is on DIVA right now, we will dedicate more time once we get a bit more capacity. If you love the 888Whales project and want to help us implementing the envisaged features, get in touch with us via our whales discord channel.
