Team DIVA had an opportunity to join India's first web3 conference event called [Web3 Conf India](https://web3confindia.xyz/) held at 
[Novotel Goa Dona Sylvia Resort](https://all.accor.com/hotel/A6P4/index.en.shtml), Goa, India. It was a three day conference event with an 
amazing cruise kick-off party before the beginning of the event. The venue was amazing and was located near the beach giving it proper Goa vibes. 
The venue was also well arranged for the events and had two different halls booked for conferences to run in parallel. There were limited seats 
for the event and it was only accessible for the people who bought NFT passes which were sold on [TickEth](https://ticketh.io/browse/01062022_AllAccessPass) platform.

## Cruise Kick-off Party

Our main plan was to make people learn about DIVA Protocol and reward them with the DIVA swags that we had prepared for the event. It was the first time 
people were going to have their swags from DIVA and we were also excited about it. At the event we secured a booth where all other companies and event sponsors 
booths were also present to interact with  attendees at the event.

We got a great response from the people that we met at the event and that we presented what we are building at DIVA Protocol and its use cases. We also encouraged people to go 
through the [DIVA docs](https://docs.divaprotocol.io/) and participate in our on-going [incentivized testnet](https://www.divaprotocol.io/posts/diva-testnet-announcement) program. 
Many of them joined our discord channel, registered their wallet to claim dUSD tokens to participate in the testnet tasks and claimed their DIVA swag.

Along with sharing information about DIVA Protocol, we also visited all the booths set up there and met with folks from different 
companies to discuss about each other's product. We met with folks from [WalletConnect](https://twitter.com/SkAyaz97/status/1558775873754386433), 
[Shardeum](https://twitter.com/SkAyaz97/status/1558764065920393221), [AssetMantle](https://assetmantle.one/), [Express Protocol](https://www.expressprotocol.io/), 
[QuillAudits](https://audits.quillhash.com/smart-contract-audit), [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/), 
[SpheronHQ](https://twitter.com/SpheronHQ), [Near Protocol](https://near.org/), [StackOS](https://www.home.stackos.io/), and 
[ZKX](https://zkx.fi/) among others. ZKX, which is a perpetual swap protocol built on StarkNet, also hosted a discussion panel about future of web3 with 
some popular faces of India in web3 space. There was also a launch party from Express Protocol on their successful mainnet launch hosted at the end of the event.

## Conclusion

To conclude, Web3 Conf India was a great event to connect with web3 enthusiasts and spread the word about DIVA Protocol and the unique use cases it will enable. We hope 
to leverage the connections that we established during the event to help grow the DIVA ecosystem.
