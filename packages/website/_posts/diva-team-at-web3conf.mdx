Team DIVA had an opportunity to join India's first web3 conference event called [Web3 Conf India](https://web3confindia.xyz/) held at [Novotel Goa Dona Sylvia Resort](https://all.accor.com/hotel/A6P4/index.en.shtml), Goa, India. It was a 3 day conference event with an amazing cruise kick-off party before the begining of the event. The venue was amazing and was located near the beach giving it proper Goa vibes, the venue was also well arranged for the events and had 2 different halls booked for conferences to run parallely at the same time. There were limited seats for the event and was only accessible for the people who bought NFT passes which were sold on [TickEth](https://ticketh.io/browse/01062022_AllAccessPass) platform.

We had a pretty much good plan to make people learn about DIVA and reward them with the DIVA swags that we had prepared for the event, it was the first time people were going to have their swags from DIVA and we were also excited about it. At the event we secured a booth where all other companies and event sponsors booths were also present to interact with  attendees at the event.

We got a great response from the people at the event as they all were very much excited about the DIVA Protocol and we presented them about what we are building at DIVA Protocol and its use cases from the DIVA slides, we also encouraged people to go through the DIVA docs and participate in the testnet task to learn more about DIVA Protocol. Many of them joined our discord channel and registered their wallet to claim dUSD tokens to participate in the testnet tasks and claimed their DIVA Swag.

Along with meeting some amazing web3 folks and sharing information about DIVA Protocol, we also visited all the booths set up there and met with folks from different companies to discuss about each other's product. We met with folks from [WalletConnect](https://twitter.com/SkAyaz97/status/1558775873754386433), [Shardeum](https://twitter.com/SkAyaz97/status/1558764065920393221), [AssetMantle](https://assetmantle.one/), [Express Protocol](https://www.expressprotocol.io/), [QuillAudits](https://audits.quillhash.com/smart-contract-audit) whom we discussed about smart contracts auditing, [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/), [SpheronHQ](https://twitter.com/SpheronHQ), [Near Protocol](https://near.org/), [StackOS](https://www.home.stackos.io/), [ZKX](https://zkx.fi/) which is a derivatives protocol built on StarkNet, StarkWareâ€™s ZK rollup. ZKX also hosted a discussion panel about future of web3 with some popular faces of India in web3 space. There was also a launch party from Express Protocol on their successful mainnet launch hosted at the end of the event.

It was great event where we got the opportunity to let people know about the DIVA Protocol and its different use cases along with creating some amazing connections. We also got to learn about many other web3 products emerging in the space and understand about their protocols. 

To conclude, we still have many things to know, learn and share and we hope to create such communications with people around us in the future and spread knowledge on what we are building at DIVA and encourage people to build something great using the protocol and hope to see our ecosystem develop with time as we progress.
