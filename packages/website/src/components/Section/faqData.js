          DIVA Protocol is a decentralized and permissionless piece of
          infrastructure that allows its users to create and settle fully
          customizable event-driven products also known as derivatives. Users
          can choose any public data feed as the underlying (e.g., the price of
          an asset or a basket of assets, the TVL locked in DeFi, Ethereum gas
          price, Bitcoin hash rate, the average temperature, etc.) and combine
          it with a wide range of possible payoff profiles (binary, linear,
          convex, or concave) to create truly unique products that do not yet
          exist in DeFi and the traditional financial world.
