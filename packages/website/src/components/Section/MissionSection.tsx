          DIVA Protocol is our contribution to this new financial system. 
          It allows to create and settle derivative products including insurance, prediction and structured products in a highly flexible way. 
          We want to see derivatives being Powered by DIVA Protocol in this new paradigm."

          future of DIVA Protocol. This includes providing grants to teams
          that are building tooling and infrastructure to simplify the
          developer experience of building on top of DIVA Protocol as well as
          teams that are building actual applications on top of DIVA Protocol
